A masters graduate, since a while. going back to the coding dojo called github

If interested, I'd be glad if you could 'watch' me too.

#what I'm doing

so this is my strategy right now:

- thinking in small steps,
-  breaking down a great projects along the wa
- getting inspired to write more code
-  reuse code that I found a value, (making it more valuable as well)

when learning sth
follow my rule:
sleep
look at problem again
repeat .. n times at least

Honestly, I'm still learning how to hone my coding skills, so that I'd be able to
provide a better version of "Quality code" when applicable
whatever project you'd be requesting in the future.

# your vote counts

I am ready to hear you out. feel free to ask me anything, about anything you'd like
(whether if they are programs you've always wanted to make - but have not enough time for, or  you could
please tell me your favorite thing, or a hobby you love to do!

surviving the day; returns would be visible only on the mid- to long term. (a few months, give or take )

# üíñ Support the project
I open-source almost everything I can,


Writing quality code requires time, efforts & to show abit of more Love
of course, You can do whatever you like with this free repo: this service for free
page made by a human to humanity. I love open-source projects, especially ones I love ,

I guess I gotta spend more time doing code reviews, plus helping others as well ( gotta learn from you, just like you're available now
for me).

However, if you found using my  projects useful, or have profited from using them, and are happy with it or just want

your contribution would encourage me do better job, next time, on for the next task.

many steps you can do, one way is to help me get more coffee - I love the Buzz ways you can help:
